# History Cleanup Notes

- Created branch `feat/three-phase-system` from the current work-in-progress commit to preserve ongoing changes.
- Reset the new `main` branch to commit `39b0606` to restore the repository to its clean state prior to the recent mix-up.
- Attempted to push `main` and `feat/three-phase-system` to `origin`, but the remote was unavailable in this environment.
- Recorded these maintenance steps for future reference.
